CSS Flexbox, Grid, Responsive Design Exercise

I wanted to challenge myself to create both cards with one HTML file
and have them switch back and forth as the window changes from portrait to landscape
aspect ratio. 

Probably doesn't make real world sense to do something like this, but it was a good
exercise to practice combinging CSS media queries and JS event listeners to coerce the design to fit the objective.
